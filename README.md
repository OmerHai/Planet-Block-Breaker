## Reflection
The goal of the project was to  deeply understand Unity and C#.


I wanted to make a game where people could play the ancient brick-breaking game that existed when I was a kid, a game that includes unbricks, breakable bricks with one or more hits.

One of the challenges was to make sure the ball flew properly when it hit the brick or the walls on one side or up,another challenge was to plan the design and gameplay of the game, to make sure that the players enjoyed as much as possible.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are Unity, C#.
