## Reflection
This is a graduation project that concludes the course "Complete React developer", the goal of the project was to realize and deeply understand React, Redux, React Router and React Design Patterns.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to buy cloths in different categories , such as hats. I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding react-route and redux.

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a time on a research authentication using Firebase. 
Another challenge was to convert Redux to be asynchronous with the help of Redux Sagas library.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, Redux-Sagas library, SASS, Firebase, JSX, and Styled-Component library. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into the technological.
